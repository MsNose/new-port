  ## What People Say About Me?

testimonial:
  - name:  Bram Faubert
    position: Associate Professor at Maastricht University
    comment: I got to know Blanka as a nice and very intelligent student in the Business Intelligence & Smart Services (BISS) master, of which I was the program director at that time. In particular, she took my course Smart Service Skills, in which students among other things get introduced to the R programming environment. Blanka was a top student in my course and the master program as a whole, and graduated Cum Laude. But Blanka also distinguished herself outside the program --- she combined her master thesis with an internship, added an exchange semester at the top school Bocconi University, and joined me at the Open Day as a student ambassador for the BISS master.

    comment: During her internship in the Gallo-Roman Museum in Tongeren, Blanka proved to be a smart, enthousiastic and multilingual asset to the team. She helped evaluate our current ticketing system by looking at best practices, interviewing people in the field, and applying her university knowledge in a practical way. A pleasure to work with!
