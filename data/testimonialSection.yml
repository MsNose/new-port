  ## What Do People Say About Me?

testimonial:
  - name:  Bram Faubert
    position: Associate Professor at Maastricht University
    comment: I got to know Blanka as a nice and very intelligent student in the Business Intelligence & Smart Services (BISS) master, of which I was the program director at that time. In particular, she took my course Smart Service Skills, in which students among other things get introduced to the R programming environment. Blanka was a top student in my course and the master program as a whole, and graduated Cum Laude. But Blanka also distinguished herself outside the program --- she combined her master thesis with an internship, added an exchange semester at the top school Bocconi University, and joined me at the Open Day as a student ambassador for the BISS master.

    position: Head of Information Management and Digitalisation at the Gallo-Roman Museum
    comment: During her internship in the Gallo-Roman Museum in Tongeren, Blanka proved to be a smart, enthousiastic and multilingual asset to the team. She helped evaluate our current ticketing system by looking at best practices, interviewing people in the field, and applying her university knowledge in a practical way. A pleasure to work with!

    position: Business Manager at Fagro Consultancy
    comment: I had the pleasure of managing Blanka during her time at Fagro Consultancy B.V. She demonstrated exceptional skills and made a strong impression. Blanka excelled in quickly learning new tools, techniques, and processes, showing great flexibility in adapting to diverse project requirements. Her soft skills, combined with her ability to effectively collaborate with both technical and non-technical stakeholders, made her a valuable asset to both internal and external teams. Blankaâ€™s strong language proficiency and her keen interest in different cultures further enhanced her ability to work seamlessly in international environments. The client she worked with on a project was highly satisfied with her performance, praising her analytical abilities and professionalism. I therefore highly recommend Blanka.
