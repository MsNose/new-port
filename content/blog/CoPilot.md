Regardless of technological advances, a lot of time is still wasted in finding information, connecting different sources and making a clear analysis. As a result, workers are often forced to use AI such as ChatGPT to increase their productivity. However, these platforms are not designed to support their specific tasks. Copilot, a new Microsoft product, is exactly the solution to this problem: It can create, summarize, analyze, collaborate and automate using your specific business content and context.

### 1.	What is Copilot? 
Copilot is a powerful feature of AI that functions as a natural language interface. This means you can interact with MS 365 apps via chat as if you were talking to a colleague. In the chat Copilot uses internally generated data by the enterprise from emails, documents, calendars, contacts and so on. Further, it suggests actions users can take, but they can check data sources before taking action. So it saves you a lot of time and may show you certain things you never thought of yourself
Basic functions of Copilot:

In addition to these basic features, there is a new feature, a Business Chat. This works across all your business data and apps to bring out the information and insights you need from a sea of data - allowing knowledge to flow freely throughout the organization and saving you valuable time searching for answers.

**Copilot & Excel**   
Copilot's basic functions can certainly help with everyday tasks, but the tool's real power lies in Excel. Here's what it can do for you:
- Data analysis. Copilot looks at your tables and brings important information into focus. Then you can dig deeper by asking Copilot questions.
- Modeling. If you're working on financial modeling, you can explore different scenarios by asking “what if” questions and providing prompts such as “model how a change in X would affect Y.”
- Visualizations. AI helps you create graphs and charts to visualize your data in a clear and understandable way.
- Writing formulas. Copilot helps you write formulas for your calculations, making creating complex formulas easier and more accessible.
- Organizing and cleaning up data. Copilot can quickly clean up messy data for you. It can remove extra spaces, merge values from different columns, highlight duplicates, sort, filter and more.
- Suggestions. Get intelligent recommendations for formulas, functions and actions based on your context.
- Insights. Discover interesting insights into your data, such as trends, outliers or correlations between different items.
- Automate tasks. Copilot can even write VBA code to help you automate common tasks. This is like creating keyboard shortcuts for things you do often.
In short, Copilot allows users to harness the full potential of Excel for efficient, data-driven insights. What does this mean for finance professionals?


**Copilot for Finance**  
Copilot for Finance includes Copilot for Microsoft 365, but on top of that, it extracts essential context from your existing financial data sources. Namely, it can connect to over 1,200 other systems (ERP, SAP, Microsoft Graph, and so on). With this extension, Excel's capabilities also expand. 
- Financial analysts can quickly perform variance analysis using natural language pointers to check data sets for discrepancies, risks and non-conforming values
- The reconciliation process is simplified with automated data structure comparisons and guided problem solving to move from insight to action, ensuring reliability and accuracy of financial records.
- Customers can turn raw data into presentation-ready visuals and reports that can be shared in Outlook and Teams.

Furthermore, Copilot for Finance offers a complete overview of relevant customer data in Outlook, such as balance statements and invoices, to speed up the collection process. With this information, Copilot can provide the first draft for customer communications, complete with relevant attachments.
Overall, with varaination analysis, collections for resolving overdue accounts, and invoice matching and reconciliation, Copilot accelerates time to decision, reduce costs for critical processes, and increase productivity.

**Use Cases**  
There are specific use cases in various industries where Copilot's tools have a significant impact.

### 2.	Market Analysis
**Competitors**  

There are several AI services on the market that challenge Copilot. It is not easy to decide which one is the best; each service excels in specialized functions. Therefore, the best AI depends on the activity for which it is used. For example, Google AI is recommended for predictive analytics, IBM Watson for cognitive computing, OpenAI for content creation and Amazon Alexa for voice commands. Copilot's strength, however, lies in document creation and data analysis.

**Copilot vs. ChatGPT**  

Although ChatGPT has proven itself as a valuable AI tool, it can be prone to misinformation and also often fails to understand nuances. However, there is an upgrade option from this imperfect GPT-3.5 model to GPT-4. The ChatGPT plus subscription uses training data up to April 2023, which is 500 times larger than the publicly available version. Copilot is based on this upgraded version, but offers additional features on top of it.

**Pros and cons**    
The comparison highlights the advantages of Copilot. The game-changing functionality is its integration with MS office apps. Copilot thus encourages collaboration and communication, which most competitors with their individualistic use do not offer. This integration increases not only productivity, but also security and compliance.  
Of course, this comes at a cost. Unless companies can use Copilot efficiently, it could be a burden. If employees had learned to use Copilot efficiently, there is a danger of over-reliance on the technology, which could have unfortunate consequences when unavoidable breakdowns occur.
Overall, the advantages of Copilot clearly outweigh the disadvantages. Copilot is the jollyjoker for companies looking to improve their basic operation and increase productivity. By leveraging this advanced AI technology, organizations can stay ahead in the rapidly evolving financial landscape.

### 3.	Implementation
**Versions**   
There are two versions for Copilot. Copilot for Microsoft 365 includes Microsoft 365 Chat, which traverses your entire universe of data (emails, meetings, chats, documents and more, plus the world wide web) to help you solve problems at work. The other option is a more general Microsoft Copilot. This version of Copilot lets you use generative AI to create and complete tasks within the Windows operating system and with Windows apps. Both require subscription: €28.10 per user per month with annual deployment.
**Requirements**  
For implementation, the requirements are trivial. To use Copilot for Microsoft 365, customers must have a license for Microsoft 365 Business Standard or Business Premium, Microsoft 365 E3 or E5 or Office 365 E3 or E5.

### 4.	Training  
**Microsoft**    
Microsoft offers the [“Getting Started with Copilot for Microsoft 365”](https://learn.microsoft.com/nl-nl/training/paths/get-started-with-microsoft-365-copilot/) training consisting of 3 modules. After a brief introduction to Copilot, the second module is dedicated to exploring the possibilities with the tool by showing examples of use within MS office apps. The third module focuses on optimization and expansion, providing tips on optimal prompt commands and integration possibilities with external services. This training is also available from the business perspective, [“Prepare your organization for Copilot for Microsoft 365”](https://learn.microsoft.com/nl-nl/training/paths/prepare-your-organization-microsoft-365-copilot/). This version focuses more on the architecture and implementation of Copilot, while also taking into account data security and compliance.Furthermore, there is a wide range of help material in the [Copilot Lab](https://copilot.cloud.microsoft/nl-NL/prompts?ocid=copilot_akams_copilotlab) that gives more practical knowledge to users.  

**LinkedIn**  
Alternatively, LinkedIn also offers an [introductory course](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/paths/get-started-with-microsoft-copilot) for Copilot. Thanks to video-based learning, Copilot's use cases are shown immediately and the audience can hear the experts' tips and tricks in short clips. There are also articles available with [cheatsheets](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/mastering-microsoft-copilot-ultimate-cheat-sheet-lakshan-obeysinghe-5w9nf/), which can be very useful in everyday use.
