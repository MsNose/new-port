shortDescription: I am a big traveller, always excited to discover the gorgeous gems of Europe. Thus, I made it my mission to collect all of my memories in Italy during my 6 months stay, and learn web development along the way.
challenge: Before this project, I have not written articles, not talking about web development. Therefore, the challange was not only to express my experiences in a comprehensive way, but also the create a platform for it.
solution: I have chosen the HUGO framework, due to its quick and user-friendy nature. It was the perfect match for RStudio, which I was already familiar with. After understanding the structure and mechanisms of web development I was able to get a hint of HTML, JavaScript and CSS Styling, and managed to organize my content and publish my travel blog.
