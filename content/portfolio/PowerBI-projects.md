shortDescription: PowerBI is a powerful tool that has always fascinated me, so I wanted to practice with it to truly harness my data skills
challenge: Compared to Tableau, PowerBI is more flexible and user-friendly, which gives a quicker intro to users. However, this comes along with a naturally more flexible structure, which needs previous planning and careful thoughts
solution: I developed two dashboards, one for the HR and one for Sales department, using data from Kaggle. The journey of transforming data into such vizualisations truly fascinated me. I learned on the way about the KPIs and their calculations, which equipped me with a better understanding of the different departments and the role they play inside companies.
