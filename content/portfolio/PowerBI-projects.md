shortDescription: PowerBI and Tableau are both fascinating BI tools, however both have their advantages and disadvantages that everyone needs to experience.
challenge: Compared to Tableau, PowerBI is more flexible and user-friendly, which gives a quicker intro to users. However, this comes along with a naturally more flexible structure, which needs previous planning and careful thoughts. 
solution:  Although PowerBI offers an easier solution for companies within the Microsoft ecosystem, Tableau is a better choice for handling and combining large datasets, as well as for leveraging complex analytics and visualizations.

In PowerBI I developed two dashboards, one for the HR and one for Sales department, using data from Kaggle. The journey of transforming data into such vizualisations truly fascinated me. I learned on the way about the KPIs and their calculations, which equipped me with a better understanding of the different departments and the role they play inside companies.

Look at my PowerBI projects on GitHub!

Furthermore, as a passionate traveler, I also wanted to gain a deeper understanding of the places I visited. My trips in the Netherlands and Belgium inspired me to build maps that create a holistic view, supporting the orientation in these diverse countries. I find Tableau Public a phenomenal place to share vizzes and learn from others, and I am looking forward to my future contribution to the community!
