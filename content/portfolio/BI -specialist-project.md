shortDescription: As a BI specialist at a leading aluminium casting company I was responsible for developing and improving the BI infrastructure that can support the decision making of the BoD.
challenge: As the company went through a rapid digital transformation, there were issues with transparency and reaching the Single Source of Truth. The data quality and governance needed to be standardized, and more effective data flow and dashboards were desired to support the data-driven decision making.
solution: Thanks to the insightful consultations with the stakeholders and the smooth cooperation with the IT and BI team several processes got automized, semantic models were built in the data warehouse, which served as valuable data sources for the dashboards. As a result, the time wasted on manual labor got reduced, and the BoD received a reliable, dynamic overview of their operations, easing future decision making.

## The situation

Due to the rapid digital transformation MGG has chosen to connect the Tableau dashboards to excel reports, which were easier and quicker to build compared to alternative data transformation processes. However, these reports were reliant on the work of multiple stakeholders and required tremendous manual work to keep it up to date. Consequently, there was no time to create and maintain complicated dashboards, leading to table-based static views that limited the value of the gathered information. 

## The data

By connecting JD Edwards and Salesforce to TimeXtender, the data warehouse at MGG, a joint overview was gained over the data infrastructure. With the use of SQL scripts views were built to satisfy the requirements for the different reports. These views were then added to semantic models with Tableau endpoints, which served as data sources for the dashboards. Our team pitched new ideas for these dashboards, proposing dynamic periodic comparisons for the KPIs and new visualizations that can shed a different light on the data. Thanks to the fruitful cooperation with the CEO, A completely new project in Sales and Balance Score Cards got developed.

## Result

By ensuring that all departments and reports were stamming from one unified root, generating multiple sources of truth got prevented. Moreover, performing data engineering and transformations inside the data warehouse, and creating live connections to the data sources did not only eliminate the meticulous manual work, but also made the creation and maintenance of dashboards more efficient. The amount of scripting in Tableau got reduced, which allowed more focus on the visuals and dynamics, and nevertheless accelerated the processing time significantly. All in all, our team received a positive feedback from the BoD. The members, instead of wasting time on debating whether the data is correct or collecting data themselves, could finally focus on interpreting the dashboards and making data-driven decisions.
