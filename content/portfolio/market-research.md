service: e-ticketing consultancy
client: Gallo-Roman Museum
shortDescription: During my last Master's semester I did an internship at a Flemish history and archaeology museum. The museum wanted to change their ticketing system, and it was my task to advice them on their choice.
challenge: The challenge for this project was to advise the Gallo-Roman Museum on transitioning their ticketing system, considering their limited resources and the need to enhance visitor experience. This involved extensive research into alternative ticketing software, conducting quantitative and qualitative analyses of similar museums, and presenting the findings to museum stakeholders. 
solution: The solution arose from identifying the financial challenges smaller museums face in independently adopting digital technologies. It proposed a collaborative approach where smaller museums pool resources to develop a tailored ticketing software solution, addressing their specific needs and budgetary constraints. This collective effort aimed to empower smaller museums in their digital transformation journey, fostering market power and ensuring sustainable growth in visitor engagement and operational efficiency.

## The task

My project consisted of 5 steps:

1. Getting to know the museum and their ticketing software.

2. Researching alternatives to the ticketing software.

3. Quantitative research: survey of other museums.

4. Qualitative research: in depth interviews of other museums.
 
5. Presenting results to the museum director and board members.


## The data

I collected data about museums in Belgium and the Netherlands with similar profiles to my target museum, and looked at the proportion if e-tickeing software they use. Then, I looked at whether the choice of software has something to do with the annual visitor numbers, which could be a crucial deciding factor. To understand the insudtry, t is also essential to have an overview of the dynamics of visitor numbers, regardless of the software they are using. By comparing the competitors based on these factors I managed to position the target museum in the market, which was a crucial first step in order to find the best solution.

## Interviews

This was followed by conducting interviews with 5 museums. The aim of the interviews was to find out the advantages and disadvantages of the current e-ticket systems these other museums were using, and compare their future plans and views in the industry. Additional information was gained about the organisational, process and technology factors of the software implementation, which served as a base material for my Master's Thesis.

## Conclusion

My research uncovered the sad fact, that the digital-technological world in museums is only something that big-sized museums can afford. Because most of  these organisations are dependent on the government, their budget is based on their visitor numbers. Unfortunately, there are just few high-visitor number museums,  most museums are small and medium sized. These smaller museums have neither the money nor the resources to hire tech-focused people, improve their operations and boost their visitor numbers. That is why these museums have to cooperate and fight for their common interest in the digital transformation. This way, with a greater market power they can create their own software for museums, which will be fully tailored to their needs. 

Despite the Master's program being conducted in English, I committed myself to learning Dutch over the course of one year. As a result, I was able to present my findings to the Museum Board in Dutch, which significantly enhanced the connection to my research.
